# Protein Structure Landscape

This repository contains data and scripts for the analysis of the protein structure landscape described in:

Szczerbiak P, Szydlowski L, Wydma≈Ñski W, Renfrew PD, Koehler Leman J, Kosciolek T. Large protein databases reveal structural complementarity and functional locality. bioRxiv, doi.org:XXXX (2024).

## Web server

The web server is available at: https://protein-structure-landscape.sano.science. 

It currently allows for:   
- structure search by ID
- structure visualization with PyMOL
- filtering based on:
    - database (AFDB, ESMAtlas, MIP)
    - superCOG functional category
    - protein length
    - pLDDT (for AFDB models only)
